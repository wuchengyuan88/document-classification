# Multi-class Document Classification

We analyze 3 Web of Science datasets (WOS-5736, WOS-11967 and WOS-46985), obtained from:
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9rw3vkcfy4/2

For each of the 3 datasets, we use 3 NLP methods (word2vec, GloVe and BERT) to perform document classification.

Also deployed a Flask app based on the above (https://wuchengyuan.pythonanywhere.com/).
