# Multi-class Document Classification

Deep Learning NLP Flask app on PythonAnywhere (https://wuchengyuan.pythonanywhere.com/)

We analyze 3 Web of Science datasets (WOS-5736, WOS-11967 and WOS-46985), obtained from:

For each of the 3 datasets, we use 3 NLP methods (word2vec, GloVe and BERT) to perform document classification.
